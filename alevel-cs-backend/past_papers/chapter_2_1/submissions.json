Packet transmission:\n\nPacket Creation: The sender creates a packet with source and destination MAC addresses.\nSent to Central Device: The packet travels via Ethernet to the switch/hub.\nCentral Device Processing:\nSwitch: Forwards the packet to the destination port using its MAC address table.\nHub: Broadcasts the packet to all devices; only the target processes it.\nDelivery: The target device receives the packet; acknowledgment may follow.\nSwitches enable efficient, targeted forwarding; hubs broadcast less efficiently.",
