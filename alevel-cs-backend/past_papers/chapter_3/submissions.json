    "answer": "The buffer in a laser printer is a temporary data storage \"transfer station\" whose core function is to resolve the speed mismatch between the computer’s data transmission rate and the printer’s physical printing speed, ensuring smooth printing. First, it balances the speed difference: it receives all data sent quickly by the computer first, then transmits it step by step at a speed the printer can handle, preventing the computer from waiting unnecessarily or the printer from \"running out of data\" mid-print. Second, it guarantees printing stability: the buffer can temporarily store data, reducing issues like garbled text or missing pages caused by interrupted data transmission. It also queues multiple print tasks in order to avoid confusion between different jobs. However, the buffer is limited by its capacity—this capacity determines the amount of data it can process at once. When the capacity is insufficient, printing large files (such as high-definition images) may slow down, as the printer has to receive data in batches from the computer.",
